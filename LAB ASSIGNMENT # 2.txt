ALGORITHMS

1.
Ask the user to enter a number.
Divide the user input by itself and check for the remainder to be equal to zero.
Divide the user input by 1 and check for the remainder to be equal to zero.
IF both step 2 and step 3 gives 0 remainder then display “ The number entered is a prime number”
Check whether the user input is less than or equal to 1, and if it is then display “The number entered is not a prime number”.
Set iteration for how many possible divisors to check
If user input modulus divisor == 0
Display “The number entered is a prime number”.
If user input modulus divisor is not equal to 0
Display “The number entered is not a prime number”.

2.
Day1 is Monday
Day2 is Tuesday
Day3 is Wednesday
Day4 is Thursday
Day5 is Friday
Day6 is Saturday
Day7 is Sunday
Ask the user to enter a day number between (1-365)
User input mod 7 is equal to 1
Display Day1
User input mod 7 is equal to 2
Display Day2
User input mod 7 is equal to 3
Display Day3
User input mod 7 is equal to 4
Display Day4
User input mod 7 is equal to 5
Display Day5
User input mod 7 is equal to 6
Display Day6
User input mod 7 is equal to 7
Display Day7


3.

Ask the user enter two numbers as input (number1 and number2) 
Set GCD equals to 0
Set divisor equals to 1
IF (number1 % divisor and number2 % divisor) ==0
 Then GCD equals to divisor
Set divisor equals to divisor + 1
Repeat step 4 till step 6
Display “The greatest common divisor is:”, GCD
